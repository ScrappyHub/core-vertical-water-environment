# CORE VERTICAL — Water, Ocean & Hydrodynamics

This repository defines the Water & Ocean vertical for CORE.

It is a **fluid-dominant physics system** for modeling water-based
resonance, flow, and environmental interactions.

## Physics Stack (Authoritative)

- HYDRA — fluid flow & turbulence
- ARES — acoustic propagation in water
- THERMOS — thermal gradients
- ATMOS — air–water coupling
- SIGNAL — anomaly detection
- RGSR — cross-domain fusion

## Real-World Phenomena Modeled

- Tsunamis
- Storm surge
- Ocean currents
- Cavitation & turbulence
- Underwater acoustics
- Flood dynamics

## What This Vertical Is

- A **hydrodynamic truth system**
- An **environmental safety analysis platform**
- A **coastal & ocean physics environment**

## What This Vertical Is Not

- Not a floodgate controller
- Not a weather forecast product
- Not emergency command software

## Registries & Lenses

- Ocean basin profiles
- Coastal geometry registries
- Sensor buoy definitions
- Environmental presets
