# CORE VERTICAL — Water & Environment

This repository defines environmental and water-system interpretation layers for CORE.

It focuses on flow behavior, turbulence, resonance, and environmental safety indicators.

## Scope
- Water flow interpretation
- Turbulence and cavitation analysis
- Environmental coupling insights
- Long-term system behavior visualization

## Non-Scope
- No infrastructure control
- No water system automation
- No physics engines
- No governance authority

## Architecture Position
Consumes outputs from HYDRA, ARES, THERMOS, and SIGNAL.

## Governance
All usage is constrained by CORE governance and safety law.
